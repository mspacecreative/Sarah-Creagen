							<p>I don&#8217;t look Japanese. Our mixed-race family is divided and the last family member we were in contact with
							who knew how to speak Japanese passed away in 2011. My work is a visual struggle between what is said
							and not said, seen and not seen. My work deals with conceptions of the erotic, sexuality, the auto-erotic,
							gender, humour, and a current investigation into the roots of my family&#8217;s mixed Japanese heritage.</p>
							<p>I have recently started working with tropes and visual cues drawn from Japanese woodblock prints (Ukiyo-e).
							My drawing practice is grounded in narrative and politics of the body. Ukiyo-e prints depict a world where
							reality and mythology, body and ghost, are described through the same narrative scenes. The artists portray
							landscape, and explicit and covert scenes of sexuality in Japanese Edo era society.</p>
							<p>In one of the more recent pieces &#8220;Geisha Face, long night&#8221;. The composition of rooms and panels in my
							drawing reference the composition of a Japanese woodblock print. The title plays with the relationship between
							the white of a skin care hydrating mask, the white made up face of a Japanese Geisha, and my own white
							looking mixed-race Japanese skin. The woman on the far left is also wearing a shirt with an image of a broken
							Japanese flag (the Rising Sun).</p>
							<p>I have been considering the idea of panels to speak to the passing of time, and as a mechanism connected to
							comics (Japanese manga). Japanese Ukiyo-e artist, Hokusai, created a comic series in the 1800s (Hokusai
							Manga). In Ukiyo-e and manga I see panels being used inventively to show separation of space within
							architecture, and also as a metaphoric divider to show passing of time.</p>
